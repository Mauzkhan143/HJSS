To design and implement the described system, we'll follow these steps:
1. Identify Classes and Relationships:
•	User: Represents a user of the system.
•	LessonManager: Manages swimming lessons.
•	CoachManager: Manages swimming coaches.
•	Lesson: Represents a swimming lesson.
•	Coach: Represents a swimming coach.
2. Define Attributes and Methods:
•	User:
•	Attributes: name, gender, age, phoneNumber, currentGradeLevel.
•	Methods: None (for simplicity).
•	LessonManager:
•	Attributes: lessons (List of Lesson objects).
•	Methods: displayTimetable(), checkLessonAvailability(), generateBookingID(), updateLessonCapacity().
•	CoachManager:
•	Attributes: coaches (List of Coach objects).
•	Methods: None (for simplicity).
•	Lesson:
•	Attributes: lessonID, day, time, gradeLevel, coach, bookedStudents[], cancelledStudents[], attendedStudents[].
•	Methods: None (for simplicity).
•	Coach:
•	Attributes: coachID, name, gender, age, phoneNumber.
•	Methods: None (for simplicity).
3. Implement Classes:
•	Implement each class in Java with appropriate attributes and methods.
4. Implement Business Logic:
•	Implement methods in LessonManager and CoachManager for managing lessons and coaches respectively.
•	Implement methods in Lesson for booking, cancelling, and attending lessons.
•	Implement methods for generating booking IDs, updating lesson capacities, etc.
5. Implement User Interface:
•	Implement a console-based user interface for interacting with the system.
•	Allow users to view timetables, book lessons, cancel lessons, attend lessons, etc.
6. Implement Unit Tests:
•	Write JUnit tests to ensure that each component of the system works as expected.
•	Test boundary cases, edge cases, and typical usage scenarios.
7. Test the System:
•	Test the system with various inputs and scenarios to ensure correctness and robustness.
8. Refactor and Optimize:
•	Refactor the code for readability, maintainability, and performance.
•	Optimize database queries, algorithm complexity, etc.
9. Document the System:
•	Document the system architecture, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.
•	Write user manuals and developer documentation.
10. Iterate and Improve:
•	Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
•	Iterate on the design and implementation based on feedback.
•	Continuously improve the system based on user needs and changing requirements.
By following these steps, we can design and implement a robust and user-friendly swimming lesson booking system.

These diagrams illustrate the relationships between different classes and the flow of messages during the execution of certain actions, such as a user viewing the timetable, checking lesson availability, generating a booking ID, and updating the lesson capacity.
